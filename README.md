# 📘 Book-Driven Web Dev Projects
This repository contains front-end projects built while working through  
> 📖 Based on exercises from *Head First HTML with CSS & XHTML* by Elisabeth Robson & Eric Freeman (O'Reilly Media).
Each folder showcases a mini concept site inspired by the book’s structured exercises. These projects helped me build a strong foundation in semantic HTML, modular layout, and accessibility-focused design.
